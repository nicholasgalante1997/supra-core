# Debugrs

## Inspiration

A simple logger for Rust based on the Node.js [`debug`](https://npmjs.com/package/debug) lightweight logging library.

## Usage

```rust
use debugrs::RsDebugger;
 
let mut debugger = RsDebugger::new(String::from("app"));
debugger.write(String::from("App booting!... :rocket:")); // > [app] App booting!... ðŸš€ +0ms
 
let mut child = debugger.extend(String::from("child-process"));
child.write(String::from("Child process booting!... :rocket:")); // > [app:child-process] Child process booting!... ðŸš€ +0ms
```

## Feature Support

- Env based label filtering
- Emoji support (thanks to the `emojis` crate)
- Timed log events

## Conventions

If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you should use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you should prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser". If you append a "*" to the end of your name, it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the DEBUG environment variable. You can then use it for normal output as well as debug output.

## Wildcards

The * character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session, you may simply do DEBUG=connect:*, or to run everything using this module simply use DEBUG=*.

Environment Variables

To enable logging for all loggers or a specific subset of loggers, you can use the `DEBUG` environment variable.

```sh
export DEBUG=*
```

or if you are using a .env file

```txt
DEBUG=*
```
