# Debugrs

## Inspiration

A simple logger for Rust based on the Node.js [`debug`](https://npmjs.com/package/debug) lightweight logging library.

## Feature Parity Benchmarks

* Env based label filtering
* Emoji support
* Timed logging events
* ANSI 256 color support
* Child logger extensions
* Granular enabling of loggers via programmatic API

## Usage

```rust
use debugrs::RsDebugger;

let mut debugger = RsDebugger::new(String::from("app"));
debugger.write(String::from("App booting!... :rocket:")); // > [app] App booting!... ðŸš€ +0ms

let mut child = debugger.extend(String::from("child-process"));
child.write(String::from("Child process booting!... :rocket:")); // > [app:child-process] Child process booting!... ðŸš€ +221ms
```  

_RsDebugger instances need to be mutable to update internal timing state within the `write` method.  

## Environment Variables

* `DEBUG`: Comma separated list of labels to log or just a single label

## Thread Safety

* `RsDebugger` is thread safe

Here's an example of using the thread-safe RsDebugger in a multithreaded environment:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use debugrs::RsDebugger;
 
fn main() {
    let mut debugger = Arc::new(Mutex::new(RsDebugger::new(String::from("app"))));

    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..5).map(|i| {
        let mut debugger = Arc::clone(&debugger);
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut debugger = debugger.lock().unwrap();
            debugger.write(format!("Log from thread {}", i));
        })
   }).collect();

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}

```

## Conventions

If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you should use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you should prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser". If you append a "*" to the end of your name, it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the DEBUG environment variable. You can then use it for normal output as well as debug output.

## Wildcards

The * character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session, you may simply do DEBUG=connect:*, or to run everything using this module simply use DEBUG=*.

Environment Variables

To enable logging for all loggers or a specific subset of loggers, you can use the `DEBUG` environment variable.

```sh
export DEBUG=*
```

or if you are using a .env file

```txt
DEBUG=*
```
